It is composed of 22 cities: the city of Manila (district 1,2,3,4,)  Quezon City, Caloocan, Las Pi\u00f1as, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Para\u00f1aque, Pasay, Pasig, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela, as well as the municipality of Pateros. The region encompasses an area of 619.57 square kilometers (239.22 sq mi) and a population of 12,877,253 as of 2015.\u200a It is the second most populous and the most densely populated region of the Philippines. It is also the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Asia and the 5th most populous urban area in the world.\n\n#### The region is the center of culture, economy, education and government of the Philippines. Designated as a global power city, the region exerts a significant impact on commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, both locally and internationally. It is the home to all the consulates and embassies in the Philippines, thereby making it an important center for international diplomacy in the country. Its economic power makes the region the country's premier center for finance and commerce. The region accounts for 37.2% of the gross domestic product of the Philippines.  \n\n#### Japanese Investors are invited to stay at Manila Hotel which is located at the heart of Manila and one of the oldest landmark of the Philippines. If an investor opened a restaurant business  to a new city unfamiliar of the competitons around that area, you most likely don\u2019t know the best place approach that fits your business theories and preferences. Moving in a country  can be challenging when it comes to business. How can you find a place that is fit for your restaurant and just perfect for you? Data Science methodologies can support answering this question.\n\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n#### For the Capstone Project of the IBM Data Science course, I used webscraping to find the most promising and populated  city in Metro Manila out of twenty two cites for the Japanese investors by taking into account their prefered priority indicator which is the dense populated people in a specific  city as well as the gravity of the competion in the same area. A detailed report can be seen in this report with the corresponding Python Code.\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "####  Target audience for this report\n#### This report is an analysis of the most populated city Metro manila and the number of the japanese resurant competitor in the sae city which customized to the needs of the Japanese investors. However, the approach is applicable to all Investor with any any desired types of Food concept. The information gathered from Foursquare in combination with data science methods are a good basis to derive data driven decisions regarding the that best fit. It would even be possible for the Filipino investor to use some similar approaches to find the perfect spot for their business.\n\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
